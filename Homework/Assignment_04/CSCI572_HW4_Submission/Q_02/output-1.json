Franklin and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and led to him writing two scientific papers, one for the astrophysics community, and one for the computer graphics community.\nGoofs\nTwo characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform. A moment later, a panoramic shot shows them fighting on a very different place.\nQuotes\n\nCooper: We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.\n\nCrazy credits\nThe Warner Bros, Paramount, Syncopy and Legendary Pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing Earth's arid dry state in the film.\nAlternate versions\nThe 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.\nConnections\nFeatured in Trailer Failure: Interstellar (2013)\nSoundtracks\nDo Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night\n(uncredited)\nWritten by Dylan Thomas\nUser reviews\n5.7K\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n10\n/10\nA visual and auditory marvel\nInterstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.\n\nThe music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.\n\nYes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.\n\nI walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.\nhelpful\n•\n588\n67\nJared_AndrewsApr 12, 2016\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nExceptional Robots on Film & TV\nFrom Transformers to droids and everything in between, these memorable robots made their mark on viewers.\nInitiate gallery viewing\nPhotos\nFAQ\n36\nHow long is Interstellar?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhat wouldve happened if they went to edmunds planet first. ?\nWhy did Earth change its history books to claim that the Apollo missions to the Moon were faked?\nHow did Cooper figure out NASA's location?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nNovember 7, 2014 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesUnited KingdomCanada\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Twitter\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nFlora's Letter\nFilming locations\nIceland\nProduction companies\nParamount PicturesWarner Bros.Legendary Entertainment\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$165,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$188,020,017\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$47,510,360Nov 9, 2014\nGross worldwide\n$733,202,212\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 49 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDatasatDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackDolby Surround 7.1\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nBreaking Bad\nInterstellar\nAbigail\nDune\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.\n\nOverall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.\nhelpful\n•\n691\n276\nchristianreedbrown-65145Feb 25, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nNew and Upcoming Sci-fi & Fantasy\nFrom intergalactic travel to happily ever afters, here are the most exciting new stories in science fiction and fantasy.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n26\nHow long is Dune: Part Two?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhat is Dune: Part Two about?\nHow much of the book will be adapted into this film?\nWill I understand Dune: Part Two if I have not seen Dune (2021)?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nMarch 1, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesCanadaUnited Arab EmiratesHungaryItalyNew ZealandJordanGambia\nOfficial site\nOfficial Site\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nDune 2\nFilming locations\nWadi Rum, Jordan\nProduction companies\nWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentVilleneuve Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$190,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$278,282,968\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$82,505,391Mar 3, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$698,282,968\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 46 minutes\nColor\nColorBlack and White\nSound mix\nDolby Surround 7.1Dolby Atmos12-Track Digital SoundIMAX 6-TrackDolby DigitalAuro 11.1Sonics-DDP\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Dune: Part Two (2024)?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nFallout\nDune: Part Two\nShōgun\nArgylle\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\nThe Gentlemen\n3 Body Problem\nRipley\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

I know Netflix bot will start giving it 8-9 star ratings to make it popular ad they do it with all their shows. But this one was a sad show instead of a comedy show. It would have been better that Sunil grover was given more length and better appearance than being same like guthi.

Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.\n\nCrazy credits\nThe Warner Bros, Paramount, Syncopy and Legendary Pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing Earth's arid dry state in the film.\nAlternate versions\nThe 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.\nConnections\nFeatured in Trailer Failure: Interstellar (2013)\nSoundtracks\nDo Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night\n(uncredited)\nWritten by Dylan Thomas\nUser reviews\n5.7K\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n10\n/10\nA visual and auditory marvel\nInterstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.\n\nThe music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.\n\nYes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.\n\nI walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.\nhelpful\n•\n588\n67\nJared_AndrewsApr 12, 2016\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nExceptional Robots on Film & TV\nFrom Transformers to droids and everything in between, these memorable robots made their mark on viewers.\nInitiate gallery viewing\nPhotos\nFAQ\n36\nHow long is Interstellar?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhat wouldve happened if they went to edmunds planet first. ?\nWhy did Earth change its history books to claim that the Apollo missions to the Moon were faked?\nHow did Cooper figure out NASA's location?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nNovember 7, 2014 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesUnited KingdomCanada\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Twitter\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nFlora's Letter\nFilming locations\nIceland\nProduction companies\nParamount PicturesWarner Bros.Legendary Entertainment\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$165,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$188,020,017\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$47,510,360Nov 9, 2014\nGross worldwide\n$733,202,212\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 49 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDatasatDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackDolby Surround 7.1\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nBreaking Bad\nInterstellar\nAbigail\nDune\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

That's the question that kept my eyes wide open and made me so hyped throughout this entire enthralling courtroom drama. In fact, I was challenged to do the work along with the jury and perceive exactly what Daniel felt. This film's realism really connected with me. It was so accurate and stressful that I forgot I was watching a film. I felt like I was watching a true story or the news or something. That is why it was very skillfully executed and well acted, as we have seen a brilliant performance from the leading actress, Sandra Hüller, who convincingly conveyed a dynamic variety of emotions.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to... Messi (the dog's real name). Feels ironic, right?

Abigail (Alisha Weir), a 12 year old girl who delights in her prowess as a ballerina is kidnapped by a six person gang. They take her to another mansion where the caper organiser Lambert (Giancarlo Esposito) tells them that they just have to hold her for 24 hours while he collects the ransom from her father. They will each receive $7 million. Seems like money for jam? Abigail is soon manipulating Joey (Melissa Barrera} a former combat medic assigned to care fot Abigail. The house itself is odd, some well appointed rooms but there are derelict quarters leading off them. The most annoying member of the gang is found decapitated, The others confront Abigail but it turns out that she is a vampire and the tables are turned. While a strong strain of black humour runs through the film this is very much a horror movie, laughter tends to die in your throat (if it isn't bitten out). Heads are lost, faces bitten out and blood sucked. The old house becomes a hunting ground as the gang fights to love rather than be undead. Some interesting vampire lore is revealed as we find out what threatens this particular type of vampire as she plays with her food. Abigail dances with a decapitated corpse, pirouettes and kick boxes ro the strains of Swan Lake, this is indeed a Black Swan. A stunning performance from Alison Weir who was 12 when Abigail was filmed ably supported by scream queens Melissa Barrera and Kathryn Newton as Sammy, as a hacker. A few interesting plot twists as well. Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett from a screenplay by Stephen Shields and Guy Busick, based on and a reimagining of the 1936 film Dracula's Daughter. 8/10.\nhelpful\n•\n2\n0\nPairicApr 23, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nNew and Upcoming Horror\nSinister sequels, eerie indies, and blockbuster boo-fests — here are the most exciting horror movies to add to your Watchlist.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n15\nHow long is Abigail?\nPowered by Alexa\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nApril 19, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nIrelandUnited StatesCanada\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Instagram\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nЕбіґейл\nFilming locations\nDublin, Ireland(main location)\nProduction companies\nProject X EntertainmentQuébec Production Services Tax CreditRadio Silence Productions\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$28,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$15,027,755\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$10,297,110Apr 21, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$19,885,249\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n1 hour 49 minutes\nColor\nColor\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Abigail (2024) in Italy?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nAbigail\nDune\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

A sequel was greenlit on the Tuesday after the film opened.

It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.\n\nThis is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the \"good\" and \"bad\" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.\n\nI would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.\n\nHowever, this is only \"Part 1\", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!\nhelpful\n•\n335\n98\nBrukernavn03Sep 14, 2021\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nReboots & Remakes\nTake a side-by-side look at some of Hollywood's biggest reboots and remakes.\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nFAQ\n29\nHow long is Dune?\nPowered by Alexa\nWho is playing Feyd?\nIs this based on a novel?\nWill there be any reference to Omnius and Erasmus?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nOctober 22, 2021 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesCanada\nOfficial sites\nOfficial siteOfficial Site (Japan)\nLanguages\nEnglishMandarin\nAlso known as\nHành Tinh Cát\nFilming locations\nWadi Rum, Jordan(Arrakis desert)\nProduction companies\nWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentVilleneuve Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$165,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$108,897,830\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$41,011,174Oct 24, 2021\nGross worldwide\n$407,573,628\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 35 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nAuro 11.1Dolby Surround 7.1Dolby AtmosDolby DigitalIMAX 6-Track\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nDune\nAbigail\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

It's meant to be on the big screen. The visuals are captivating, the music is mesmerizing and the actors are convincing.\n\nThis is an adaptation of the Dune novel from 1965, and it covers about half the book. I have read the novel long ago, but I'm mostly familiar with the Dune universe from the Command & Conquer game Emperor: Battle for Dune. It's a vast universe with politics, religion, tribes and houses. The movie does an excellent job of placing you in this grand setting without over-explaining everything, but also without feeling completely lost. For someone new to the Dune universe you can easily recognize who the \"good\" and \"bad\" guys are and follow the plot, without knowing who all the different names refer to. But it's not dumbed down so that those who will recognize the names feel patronized. This is very hard to pull off, but I think this movie did so masterfully.\n\nI would describe it as a mixture between Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. You follow individuals in a grand and complex world. The majority of the movie takes place on a desert planet, so it really needed an amazing soundtrack to elevate the experience - and it has. Hans Zimmer turned down Tenet to work on Dune, and I think he made the right choice.\n\nHowever, this is only \"Part 1\", as it says in the beginning of the movie, so you know it won't be a complete story. I was ready to watch Part 2 as soon as it ended, but will have to wait. LOTR The fellowship of the Ring would be an insignificant movie without The two towers and The return of a king to complete the story. Together they are great, individually they are not enough. So it is with Dune - It is a great introduction, but it desperately needs a part 2 to conclude the story. And there better be a Part 2!\nhelpful\n•\n335\n98\nBrukernavn03Sep 14, 2021\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nReboots & Remakes\nTake a side-by-side look at some of Hollywood's biggest reboots and remakes.\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nFAQ\n29\nHow long is Dune?\nPowered by Alexa\nWho is playing Feyd?\nIs this based on a novel?\nWill there be any reference to Omnius and Erasmus?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nOctober 22, 2021 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesCanada\nOfficial sites\nOfficial siteOfficial Site (Japan)\nLanguages\nEnglishMandarin\nAlso known as\nHành Tinh Cát\nFilming locations\nWadi Rum, Jordan(Arrakis desert)\nProduction companies\nWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentVilleneuve Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$165,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$108,897,830\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$41,011,174Oct 24, 2021\nGross worldwide\n$407,573,628\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 35 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nAuro 11.1Dolby Surround 7.1Dolby AtmosDolby DigitalIMAX 6-Track\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nDune\nAbigail\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

Abigail (Alisha Weir), a 12 year old girl who delights in her prowess as a ballerina is kidnapped by a six person gang. They take her to another mansion where the caper organiser Lambert (Giancarlo Esposito) tells them that they just have to hold her for 24 hours while he collects the ransom from her father. They will each receive $7 million. Seems like money for jam? Abigail is soon manipulating Joey (Melissa Barrera} a former combat medic assigned to care fot Abigail. The house itself is odd, some well appointed rooms but there are derelict quarters leading off them. The most annoying member of the gang is found decapitated, The others confront Abigail but it turns out that she is a vampire and the tables are turned. While a strong strain of black humour runs through the film this is very much a horror movie, laughter tends to die in your throat (if it isn't bitten out). Heads are lost, faces bitten out and blood sucked. The old house becomes a hunting ground as the gang fights to love rather than be undead. Some interesting vampire lore is revealed as we find out what threatens this particular type of vampire as she plays with her food. Abigail dances with a decapitated corpse, pirouettes and kick boxes ro the strains of Swan Lake, this is indeed a Black Swan. A stunning performance from Alison Weir who was 12 when Abigail was filmed ably supported by scream queens Melissa Barrera and Kathryn Newton as Sammy, as a hacker. A few interesting plot twists as well. Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett from a screenplay by Stephen Shields and Guy Busick, based on and a reimagining of the 1936 film Dracula's Daughter. 8/10.\nhelpful\n•\n2\n0\nPairicApr 23, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nNew and Upcoming Horror\nSinister sequels, eerie indies, and blockbuster boo-fests — here are the most exciting horror movies to add to your Watchlist.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n15\nHow long is Abigail?\nPowered by Alexa\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nApril 19, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nIrelandUnited StatesCanada\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Instagram\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nЕбіґейл\nFilming locations\nDublin, Ireland(main location)\nProduction companies\nProject X EntertainmentQuébec Production Services Tax CreditRadio Silence Productions\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$28,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$15,027,755\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$10,297,110Apr 21, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$19,885,249\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n1 hour 49 minutes\nColor\nColor\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Abigail (2024) in Italy?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nDune\nAbigail\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

However, being a movie and required to fit the time allowed, we don't learn much about Tom Ripley's back story, his normal life, nor of the many side stories in Europe. We know that, when he is mistaken for a Princeton guy, he doesn't correct the record. We learn early that deception is his friend.\n\nIn this 8-part series called just \"Ripley\" we see more clearly that this Tom is a bit older and how he lives the life of a grifter in New York. For example, he encounters the mail carrier and pretends to be going into the Dr Office, is handed the mail, he finds checks that he can cash. Or he pretends to be a bill collector and has a new check sent to his \"agency.\" Using a variety of fictional identities, if a bank gets suspicious he just walks away and destroys that identity. He is slick and unperturbed, a man on his mission.\n\nSo the entire series has the same core story, with the same core characters and their relationships, but it treats Tom in a distinctly different light. It starts when Mr Greenleaf hires a P. I. to find Ripley, we are not sure why he knows about him, but that is how Tom gets the paid assignment to go to Italy and find Dickie.\n\nThere are a number of other differences but Tom is forever the grifter and when he realizes what Dicky has he wants it too. He wants that life, and the first episode ends with him practicing in the mirror, introducing himself as Dicky Greenleaf, foreshadowing what the rest of the series will be about.\n\nThe show is shot in B&W, which I see some complain about. But I love it, to give it that 'film noir' look and feel. With much more running time to play with it goes a bit deeper in some familiar scenes and also adds some that were not included in the movie. And finally, the last scenes and the ending are heading into a completely different direction.\n\nIn my mind there is no value trying to compare this 6 1/2 hour miniseries to the 1999 movie, they are quite different takes on the same core story. I like what they did here, I like the more deliberate pace, I like the B&W approach, to me it helps it feel like 1960s Italy.\n\nDark but good series, entertaining.\nhelpful\n•\n105\n20\nTxMikeApr 3, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nEverything New on Netflix in April\nNo need to waste time endlessly scrolling — here's the entire lineup of new movies and TV shows streaming on Netflix this month.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n14\nHow many seasons does Ripley have?\nPowered by Alexa\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nApril 4, 2024 (United States)\nCountry of origin\nUnited States\nOfficial sites\nOfficial NetflixWikipedia\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nРіплі\nFilming locations\nPio Monte della Misericordia, Via dei Tribunali, 253, 80139 Napoli NA, Italy(Home of Caravaggio's 'The Seven Works of Mercy'.)\nProduction companies\nDiveEndemol Shine North AmericaEntertainment 360\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n1 hour\nColor\nBlack and White\nSound mix\nDolby Digital\nAspect ratio\n1.78 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Ripley (2024) in Canada?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nAdd episode\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nRipley\nChallengers\nOppenheimer\nPoor Things\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

This film stock was chosen specifically for its heritage - it was originally sold to photographers as Super-XX during World War II and was very popular with photojournalists of the era.\nGoofs\nThe stop signs are yellow in the film, which is accurate. The United States used yellow stop signs until 1954.\nQuotes\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer: Albert? When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world...\n\nAlbert Einstein: I remember it well. What of it?\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer: I believe we did.\n\nAlternate versions\nTo get a U/A rating certification in India, the movie was edited to remove or censor all nudity using CGI. For example, the scene where Tatlock and Oppenheimer have a conversation and the former character was topless, the nudity was censored with a CGI black dress. Many Middle Eastern countries use this exact same censored version for release.\nConnections\nFeatured in Louder with Crowder: Going Out with a Bang! (2022)\nUser reviews\n4.1K\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n9\n/10\nNolan at his best!\nAs VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.\n\nThe cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.\n\nLastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.\n\nBecause this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.\nhelpful\n•\n352\n149\nshivamkanodia-94992Jul 18, 2023\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nFAQ\n38\nHow long is Oppenheimer?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhy did Niels Bohr not help with the Manhattan project?\nDid Truman really call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby?\"\nWere there black people working for the Manhattan project?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nJuly 21, 2023 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesUnited Kingdom\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Instagram\nLanguages\nEnglishGermanItalian\nAlso known as\nOppengeymer\nFilming locations\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, USA(only interiors, Los Alamos facilities interiors, including Oppenheimer's house, Fuller Lodge Interior and Exterior)\nProduction companies\nUniversal PicturesAtlas EntertainmentGadget Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$100,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$329,862,540\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$82,455,420Jul 23, 2023\nGross worldwide\n$971,612,566\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n3 hours\nColor\nColorBlack and White\nSound mix\nIMAX 6-TrackDolby DigitalDatasatDTS 70 mm\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

Isaac and Dafoe informed Ruffalo he was fired and, indeed, getting replaced by Isaac.\nGoofs\nWhen Bella returns to London to visit the dying Godwin; she gets off the carriage and closes the door with her empty right hand.

This film stock was chosen specifically for its heritage - it was originally sold to photographers as Super-XX during World War II and was very popular with photojournalists of the era.\nGoofs\nThe stop signs are yellow in the film, which is accurate. The United States used yellow stop signs until 1954.\nQuotes\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer: Albert? When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world...\n\nAlbert Einstein: I remember it well. What of it?\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer: I believe we did.\n\nAlternate versions\nTo get a U/A rating certification in India, the movie was edited to remove or censor all nudity using CGI. For example, the scene where Tatlock and Oppenheimer have a conversation and the former character was topless, the nudity was censored with a CGI black dress. Many Middle Eastern countries use this exact same censored version for release.\nConnections\nFeatured in Louder with Crowder: Going Out with a Bang! (2022)\nUser reviews\n4.1K\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n9\n/10\nNolan at his best!\nAs VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.\n\nThe cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.\n\nLastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.\n\nBecause this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.\nhelpful\n•\n352\n149\nshivamkanodia-94992Jul 18, 2023\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nFAQ\n38\nHow long is Oppenheimer?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhy did Niels Bohr not help with the Manhattan project?\nDid Truman really call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby?\"\nWere there black people working for the Manhattan project?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nJuly 21, 2023 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesUnited Kingdom\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Instagram\nLanguages\nEnglishGermanItalian\nAlso known as\nOppengeymer\nFilming locations\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, USA(only interiors, Los Alamos facilities interiors, including Oppenheimer's house, Fuller Lodge Interior and Exterior)\nProduction companies\nUniversal PicturesAtlas EntertainmentGadget Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$100,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$329,862,540\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$82,455,420Jul 23, 2023\nGross worldwide\n$971,612,566\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n3 hours\nColor\nColorBlack and White\nSound mix\nIMAX 6-TrackDolby DigitalDatasatDTS 70 mm\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

What I'm trying to say while pointing Aristotle's quote into a mirror, is that this is worth watching simply for all of the outstanding individual performances. There are many other reasons to tune in, but the acting clinic on parade here is a lot of fun.\n\nThe Parts:\n\n#1 - The Story\n\nOf course, this story began with the film but has only a very tangential relationship with that work. Every episode has a beginning, middle, and an end, as well as a cliffhanger or something else to propel viewers onward. As with his movies, some of the stories worked for me, others didn't. Some of the conflicts were just way too facile with their resolutions. Eddie was pushed into way too many predicaments as he tried to extract his family from the business, accepting too many dangerous assignments for reasons not adequately explained, not to me.\n\n#2 - The Dialogue\n\nRitchie seems to have developed his own form of dialogue in which street toughs and lowlifes converse with a sort of modern day Shakespearean banter, well above the vernacular of the average dirtbag, whether in real life or in other movies. While Tarantino was propelled into stardom for the way in which some of his characters lapse into long soliloquys, whether on their own or in a group, Ritchie's creations throw around a lot of word-a-day calendar vocabulary in their speechifying. It comes off affected at times, but more often than not his dialogue is a lot of fun.\n\n#3 - The Characters\n\nBringing fun-as-hell characters to life on the screen is definitely Ritchie's strong point, or one of them. Eddie, Susie, Jimmy, Bobby, and Geoff could all walk away from this and carry their own series. It helps to have such talented actors reading you lines, and it definitely is important for actors to have great material to spin into the roles they help to create.\n\nCompared to about 99% of what is out there in TV and movie land, this series was positively brilliant.

What I'm trying to say while pointing Aristotle's quote into a mirror, is that this is worth watching simply for all of the outstanding individual performances. There are many other reasons to tune in, but the acting clinic on parade here is a lot of fun.\n\nThe Parts:\n\n#1 - The Story\n\nOf course, this story began with the film but has only a very tangential relationship with that work. Every episode has a beginning, middle, and an end, as well as a cliffhanger or something else to propel viewers onward. As with his movies, some of the stories worked for me, others didn't. Some of the conflicts were just way too facile with their resolutions. Eddie was pushed into way too many predicaments as he tried to extract his family from the business, accepting too many dangerous assignments for reasons not adequately explained, not to me.\n\n#2 - The Dialogue\n\nRitchie seems to have developed his own form of dialogue in which street toughs and lowlifes converse with a sort of modern day Shakespearean banter, well above the vernacular of the average dirtbag, whether in real life or in other movies. While Tarantino was propelled into stardom for the way in which some of his characters lapse into long soliloquys, whether on their own or in a group, Ritchie's creations throw around a lot of word-a-day calendar vocabulary in their speechifying. It comes off affected at times, but more often than not his dialogue is a lot of fun.\n\n#3 - The Characters\n\nBringing fun-as-hell characters to life on the screen is definitely Ritchie's strong point, or one of them. Eddie, Susie, Jimmy, Bobby, and Geoff could all walk away from this and carry their own series. It helps to have such talented actors reading you lines, and it definitely is important for actors to have great material to spin into the roles they help to create.\n\nCompared to about 99% of what is out there in TV and movie land, this series was positively brilliant. Period.\nhelpful\n•\n63\n20\nleftbanker-1Mar 9, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nFAQ\n16\nHow many seasons does The Gentlemen have?\nPowered by Alexa\nIs this the first time that Guy Ritchie used a song in two (or more) projects?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nMarch 7, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited KingdomUnited States\nOfficial site\nOfficial Netflix\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nQuý Ông Thế Giới Ngầm\nFilming locations\nBadminton House, Gloucestershire, England, UK(Halstead Manor exteriors, hallway and stairs)\nProduction companies\nMiramax TelevisionMoonage PicturesToff Guy Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n50 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby Digital\nAspect ratio\n16:9 HD\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to The Gentlemen (2024) in Australia?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nAdd episode\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nThe Gentlemen\nLate Night with the Devil\nMonkey Man\n3 Body Problem\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

I especially loved the main leads like Alan Ritcherson and Henry Cavil were wonderful plus was surprised to see Alex Petiffer I thought he wasn't acting anymore.

But I was completely wrong.\n\nThis is a taste of war experience that shows you the cruelty of real war. It's so direct. It doesn't confuse you with big talks about politics about powers and conflicts. Instead, it puts you in a position that is vulnerable and also in the very front line of war, it's all about experience rather than telling you a intriguing story.\nhelpful\n•\n89\n63\ncamwang-43373Apr 10, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nFAQ\n16\nHow long is Civil War?\nPowered by Alexa\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nApril 12, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesUnited Kingdom\nOfficial site\nA24\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nNgày Tàn Của Đế Quốc\nFilming locations\nAtlanta, Georgia, USA\nProduction companies\nA24DNA FilmsIPR.VC\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$50,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$51,095,460\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$25,537,368Apr 14, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$66,510,626\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n1 hour 49 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackDolby Atmos\nAspect ratio\n1.85 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Civil War (2024)?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nCivil War\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

With less hair, the samurai would also not suffer from the buildup of heat on the head when wearing the helmet.\nQuotes\n\nYoshii Toranaga: Why is it that only those who have never fought in a battle are so eager to be in one?\n\nCrazy credits\nThe opening credit sequence is a modified version of a zen garden. This style of garden is often referred to as karesansui, which means \"not using water.\"The two main elements of a Zen or karesansui (pronounced \"kah-ray-sahn-soo-ee\") garden are rocks to represent mountains (or islands) and sand to represent water. The sand used in Zen gardens is not beach sand; it is actually crushed or decomposed granite, small pebbles, or fine gravel. The particles of crushed granite are angular rather than round, so they can be more easily raked into patterns. Moreover, ripples in the sand or gravel represent flowing water or ripples in the ocean.\nConnections\nFeatured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: The Rat of All My Dreams (2020)\nUser reviews\n475\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\nAn amazing television achievement but different from the book\nThis is stunning television. The costumes, the sets, the historic period acting are all phenomenal. This show simply oozes dedication to detail and money. So with just two episodes in I can say that this will hook you almost immediately and for fans of Japan and its ancient culture it is almost a must-see.\n\nKnowing the book the casting is near pitch-perfect or at least close enough to it. Maybe Lady Mariko doesn't look as I imagined her from the book but the actress still delivers a good performance and I am deeply appreciative of this show for making a worthy effort to depict the vast and intricate world of James Clavell's masterful historic novel.\n\nHowever, maybe the book is too big to fit into the confined space of a TV series. For obvious reasons the showrunners had to rush through so much that is explained and described in detail in the book. In order to do the book justice it would have taken almost two seasons of television to show the story of John Blackthorne before he even reaches Osaka. Much of the underlying conflicts and the delicate web of diplomacy and intrigue the main characters have to navigate are cut short in the TV show. There also is a weird shift in perspective which strays from the book. Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.\n\nBottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.\nhelpful\n•\n213\n68\nKevin-42Feb 26, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nReboots & Remakes\nTake a side-by-side look at some of Hollywood's biggest reboots and remakes.\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nFAQ\n15\nHow many seasons does Shōgun have?\nPowered by Alexa\nIs episode 10 the final episode of Season 1?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nFebruary 27, 2024 (United States)\nCountry of origin\nUnited States\nOfficial site\nDisney+ Hotstar Indonesia\nLanguages\nJapaneseEnglish\nAlso known as\nĐại Tướng Quân\nFilming locations\nVancouver, British Columbia, Canada\nProduction companies\nDNA FilmsFX ProductionsGate 34 Productions\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby DigitalDolby Atmos\nAspect ratio\n2.00 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Shōgun (2024) in Germany?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nAdd episode\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nFallout\nDune: Part Two\nShōgun\nArgylle\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\nThe Gentlemen\n3 Body Problem\nRipley\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.\n\nOverall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.\nhelpful\n•\n691\n276\nchristianreedbrown-65145Feb 25, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nNew and Upcoming Sci-fi & Fantasy\nFrom intergalactic travel to happily ever afters, here are the most exciting new stories in science fiction and fantasy.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n26\nHow long is Dune: Part Two?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhat is Dune: Part Two about?\nHow much of the book will be adapted into this film?\nWill I understand Dune: Part Two if I have not seen Dune (2021)?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nMarch 1, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesCanadaUnited Arab EmiratesHungaryItalyNew ZealandJordanGambia\nOfficial site\nOfficial Site\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nDune 2\nFilming locations\nWadi Rum, Jordan\nProduction companies\nWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentVilleneuve Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$190,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$278,282,968\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$82,505,391Mar 3, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$698,282,968\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 46 minutes\nColor\nColorBlack and White\nSound mix\nDolby Surround 7.1Dolby Atmos12-Track Digital SoundIMAX 6-TrackDolby DigitalAuro 11.1Sonics-DDP\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Dune: Part Two (2024)?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nDune: Part Two\nFallout\nShōgun\nArgylle\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\nThe Gentlemen\n3 Body Problem\nRipley\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

(2023)\nUser reviews\n841\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n9\n/10\nPsssst... It's OK to like the show even if it isn't perfect!\nLike many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.\n\nWith that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.\n\nTo the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.\n\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.\n\nFor me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.\nhelpful\n•\n247\n104\nmayaschneiderbscApr 11, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nApril 2024 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates\nThe steamy limited series \"Mary & George\" is one of the biggest TV and streaming premieres this month.

(2023)\nUser reviews\n841\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n9\n/10\nPsssst... It's OK to like the show even if it isn't perfect!\nLike many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.\n\nWith that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.\n\nTo the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.\n\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.\n\nFor me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games.

An f-bomb, it would've gotten another star from me.\nhelpful\n•\n18\n5\npostmidnightFeb 6, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nFAQ\n17\nHow long is Argylle?\nPowered by Alexa\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nFebruary 2, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited KingdomUnited States\nOfficial sites\nOfficial FacebookOfficial Instagram\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nArgylle - Siêu Điệp Viên\nFilming locations\nGreece\nProduction companies\nApple Original FilmsMarv FilmsCloudy Productions\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$200,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$45,207,275\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$17,473,540Feb 4, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$96,170,413\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 19 minutes\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby DigitalIMAX 6-TrackDolby Atmos\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Argylle (2024)?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nArgylle\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\nThe Gentlemen\n3 Body Problem\nDune: Part Two\nRipley\nShōgun\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nFallout\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

For a movie that has to do with nazi's and a group that takes them out I very much enjoyed this take on taking down a bunch of nazi's very fun thrill ride all around deserving of the high ratings! I especially loved the main leads like Alan Ritcherson and Henry Cavil were wonderful plus was surprised to see Alex Petiffer I thought he wasn't acting anymore. Guy Ritchie always has done great films at least most of them. Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is one of the best war types I've seen, I hope many others appreciate it.\nhelpful\n•\n4\n0\nUniqueParticleApr 23, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nFAQ\n15\nHow long is The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare?\nPowered by Alexa\nChristopher Lee was actually a part of the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, why wasn't one of the actors (Henry Cavill maybe) written to portray Christopher Lee as a tribute?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nApril 19, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesUnited KingdomTurkey\nOfficial site\nOfficial Site\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nYour Lucky Day\nFilming locations\nAntalya, Turkey\nProduction companies\nBlack BearJerry Bruckheimer FilmsLionsgate Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$60,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$12,688,667\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$8,913,698Apr 21, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$13,155,998\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby Digital\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024)?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\nThe Gentlemen\n3 Body Problem\nDune: Part Two\nRipley\nShōgun\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nFallout\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

There are many other reasons to tune in, but the acting clinic on parade here is a lot of fun.\n\nThe Parts:\n\n#1 - The Story\n\nOf course, this story began with the film but has only a very tangential relationship with that work. Every episode has a beginning, middle, and an end, as well as a cliffhanger or something else to propel viewers onward. As with his movies, some of the stories worked for me, others didn't. Some of the conflicts were just way too facile with their resolutions. Eddie was pushed into way too many predicaments as he tried to extract his family from the business, accepting too many dangerous assignments for reasons not adequately explained, not to me.\n\n#2 - The Dialogue\n\nRitchie seems to have developed his own form of dialogue in which street toughs and lowlifes converse with a sort of modern day Shakespearean banter, well above the vernacular of the average dirtbag, whether in real life or in other movies. While Tarantino was propelled into stardom for the way in which some of his characters lapse into long soliloquys, whether on their own or in a group, Ritchie's creations throw around a lot of word-a-day calendar vocabulary in their speechifying. It comes off affected at times, but more often than not his dialogue is a lot of fun.\n\n#3 - The Characters\n\nBringing fun-as-hell characters to life on the screen is definitely Ritchie's strong point, or one of them. Eddie, Susie, Jimmy, Bobby, and Geoff could all walk away from this and carry their own series. It helps to have such talented actors reading you lines, and it definitely is important for actors to have great material to spin into the roles they help to create.\n\nCompared to about 99% of what is out there in TV and movie land, this series was positively brilliant.

It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.\nhelpful\n•\n691\n276\nchristianreedbrown-65145Feb 25, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nNew and Upcoming Sci-fi & Fantasy\nFrom intergalactic travel to happily ever afters, here are the most exciting new stories in science fiction and fantasy.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n26\nHow long is Dune: Part Two?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhat is Dune: Part Two about?\nHow much of the book will be adapted into this film?\nWill I understand Dune: Part Two if I have not seen Dune (2021)?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nMarch 1, 2024 (United States)\nCountries of origin\nUnited StatesCanadaUnited Arab EmiratesHungaryItalyNew ZealandJordanGambia\nOfficial site\nOfficial Site\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nDune 2\nFilming locations\nWadi Rum, Jordan\nProduction companies\nWarner Bros.Legendary EntertainmentVilleneuve Films\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nBox office\nEdit\nBudget\n$190,000,000 (estimated)\nGross US & Canada\n$278,282,968\nOpening weekend US & Canada\n$82,505,391Mar 3, 2024\nGross worldwide\n$698,282,968\nSee detailed box office info on IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n2 hours 46 minutes\nColor\nColorBlack and White\nSound mix\nDolby Surround 7.1Dolby Atmos12-Track Digital SoundIMAX 6-TrackDolby DigitalAuro 11.1Sonics-DDP\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Dune: Part Two (2024)?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nDune: Part Two\nRipley\nShōgun\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nFallout\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

However, being a movie and required to fit the time allowed, we don't learn much about Tom Ripley's back story, his normal life, nor of the many side stories in Europe. We know that, when he is mistaken for a Princeton guy, he doesn't correct the record. We learn early that deception is his friend.\n\nIn this 8-part series called just \"Ripley\" we see more clearly that this Tom is a bit older and how he lives the life of a grifter in New York. For example, he encounters the mail carrier and pretends to be going into the Dr Office, is handed the mail, he finds checks that he can cash. Or he pretends to be a bill collector and has a new check sent to his \"agency.\" Using a variety of fictional identities, if a bank gets suspicious he just walks away and destroys that identity. He is slick and unperturbed, a man on his mission.\n\nSo the entire series has the same core story, with the same core characters and their relationships, but it treats Tom in a distinctly different light. It starts when Mr Greenleaf hires a P. I. to find Ripley, we are not sure why he knows about him, but that is how Tom gets the paid assignment to go to Italy and find Dickie.\n\nThere are a number of other differences but Tom is forever the grifter and when he realizes what Dicky has he wants it too. He wants that life, and the first episode ends with him practicing in the mirror, introducing himself as Dicky Greenleaf, foreshadowing what the rest of the series will be about.\n\nThe show is shot in B&W, which I see some complain about. But I love it, to give it that 'film noir' look and feel. With much more running time to play with it goes a bit deeper in some familiar scenes and also adds some that were not included in the movie. And finally, the last scenes and the ending are heading into a completely different direction.\n\nIn my mind there is no value trying to compare this 6 1/2 hour miniseries to the 1999 movie, they are quite different takes on the same core story. I like what they did here, I like the more deliberate pace, I like the B&W approach, to me it helps it feel like 1960s Italy.\n\nDark but good series, entertaining.\nhelpful\n•\n105\n20\nTxMikeApr 3, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nApril 2024 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates\nThe steamy limited series \"Mary & George\" is one of the biggest TV and streaming premieres this month.

With less hair, the samurai would also not suffer from the buildup of heat on the head when wearing the helmet.\nQuotes\n\nYoshii Toranaga: Why is it that only those who have never fought in a battle are so eager to be in one?\n\nCrazy credits\nThe opening credit sequence is a modified version of a zen garden. This style of garden is often referred to as karesansui, which means \"not using water.\"The two main elements of a Zen or karesansui (pronounced \"kah-ray-sahn-soo-ee\") garden are rocks to represent mountains (or islands) and sand to represent water. The sand used in Zen gardens is not beach sand; it is actually crushed or decomposed granite, small pebbles, or fine gravel. The particles of crushed granite are angular rather than round, so they can be more easily raked into patterns. Moreover, ripples in the sand or gravel represent flowing water or ripples in the ocean.\nConnections\nFeatured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: The Rat of All My Dreams (2020)\nUser reviews\n475\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\nAn amazing television achievement but different from the book\nThis is stunning television. The costumes, the sets, the historic period acting are all phenomenal. This show simply oozes dedication to detail and money. So with just two episodes in I can say that this will hook you almost immediately and for fans of Japan and its ancient culture it is almost a must-see.\n\nKnowing the book the casting is near pitch-perfect or at least close enough to it. Maybe Lady Mariko doesn't look as I imagined her from the book but the actress still delivers a good performance and I am deeply appreciative of this show for making a worthy effort to depict the vast and intricate world of James Clavell's masterful historic novel.\n\nHowever, maybe the book is too big to fit into the confined space of a TV series. For obvious reasons the showrunners had to rush through so much that is explained and described in detail in the book. In order to do the book justice it would have taken almost two seasons of television to show the story of John Blackthorne before he even reaches Osaka. Much of the underlying conflicts and the delicate web of diplomacy and intrigue the main characters have to navigate are cut short in the TV show. There also is a weird shift in perspective which strays from the book. Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.\n\nBottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.\nhelpful\n•\n213\n68\nKevin-42Feb 26, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nReboots & Remakes\nTake a side-by-side look at some of Hollywood's biggest reboots and remakes.\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nFAQ\n15\nHow many seasons does Shōgun have?\nPowered by Alexa\nIs episode 10 the final episode of Season 1?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nFebruary 27, 2024 (United States)\nCountry of origin\nUnited States\nOfficial site\nDisney+ Hotstar Indonesia\nLanguages\nJapaneseEnglish\nAlso known as\nĐại Tướng Quân\nFilming locations\nVancouver, British Columbia, Canada\nProduction companies\nDNA FilmsFX ProductionsGate 34 Productions\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby DigitalDolby Atmos\nAspect ratio\n2.00 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Shōgun (2024) in Germany?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nAdd episode\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nPhotos\nTrending Actors in Their Early Roles\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nNew and Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy\nSee the list\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nRipley\nShōgun\nBaby Reindeer\nCivil War\nFallout\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

With less hair, the samurai would also not suffer from the buildup of heat on the head when wearing the helmet.\nQuotes\n\nYoshii Toranaga: Why is it that only those who have never fought in a battle are so eager to be in one?\n\nCrazy credits\nThe opening credit sequence is a modified version of a zen garden. This style of garden is often referred to as karesansui, which means \"not using water.\"The two main elements of a Zen or karesansui (pronounced \"kah-ray-sahn-soo-ee\") garden are rocks to represent mountains (or islands) and sand to represent water. The sand used in Zen gardens is not beach sand; it is actually crushed or decomposed granite, small pebbles, or fine gravel. The particles of crushed granite are angular rather than round, so they can be more easily raked into patterns. Moreover, ripples in the sand or gravel represent flowing water or ripples in the ocean.\nConnections\nFeatured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: The Rat of All My Dreams (2020)\nUser reviews\n475\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\nAn amazing television achievement but different from the book\nThis is stunning television. The costumes, the sets, the historic period acting are all phenomenal. This show simply oozes dedication to detail and money. So with just two episodes in I can say that this will hook you almost immediately and for fans of Japan and its ancient culture it is almost a must-see.\n\nKnowing the book the casting is near pitch-perfect or at least close enough to it. Maybe Lady Mariko doesn't look as I imagined her from the book but the actress still delivers a good performance and I am deeply appreciative of this show for making a worthy effort to depict the vast and intricate world of James Clavell's masterful historic novel.\n\nHowever, maybe the book is too big to fit into the confined space of a TV series. For obvious reasons the showrunners had to rush through so much that is explained and described in detail in the book. In order to do the book justice it would have taken almost two seasons of television to show the story of John Blackthorne before he even reaches Osaka. Much of the underlying conflicts and the delicate web of diplomacy and intrigue the main characters have to navigate are cut short in the TV show. There also is a weird shift in perspective which strays from the book. Whereas the involvement of Portuguese foreigners in the politics of early 17th century Japan is treated as just another aspect in a mostly internal Japanese power struggle, the TV show almost sets the Portuguese up as the main antagonists of the show during its first two episodes. I hope the shows swings back to the Japan-centric story it is meant to be.\n\nBottom line: This is great television but I recommend reading the book eventually.\nhelpful\n•\n213\n68\nKevin-42Feb 26, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nReboots & Remakes\nTake a side-by-side look at some of Hollywood's biggest reboots and remakes.\nSee the gallery\nPhotos\nFAQ\n15\nHow many seasons does Shōgun have?\nPowered by Alexa\nIs episode 10 the final episode of Season 1?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nFebruary 27, 2024 (United States)\nCountry of origin\nUnited States\nOfficial site\nDisney+ Hotstar Indonesia\nLanguages\nJapaneseEnglish\nAlso known as\nĐại Tướng Quân\nFilming locations\nVancouver, British Columbia, Canada\nProduction companies\nDNA FilmsFX ProductionsGate 34 Productions\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby DigitalDolby Atmos\nAspect ratio\n2.00 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Shōgun (2024) in Germany?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nAdd episode\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nSponsored \nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nSponsored \nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nBaby Reindeer\nShōgun\nCivil War\nFallout\nSponsored \nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"

(2023)\nUser reviews\n841\nReview\nFEATURED REVIEW\n9\n/10\nPsssst... It's OK to like the show even if it isn't perfect!\nLike many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.\n\nWith that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.\n\nTo the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.\n\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.\n\nFor me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.\nhelpful\n•\n247\n104\nmayaschneiderbscApr 11, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nApril 2024 TV and Streaming Premiere Dates\nThe steamy limited series \"Mary & George\" is one of the biggest TV and streaming premieres this month.

I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.\n\nTo the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.\n\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.\n\nFor me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.\nhelpful\n•\n247\n104\nmayaschneiderbscApr 11, 2024\nTop picks\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\nSign in\nNew and Upcoming Sci-fi & Fantasy\nFrom intergalactic travel to happily ever afters, here are the most exciting new stories in science fiction and fantasy.\nSee the list\nList\nFAQ\n13\nHow many seasons does Fallout have?\nPowered by Alexa\nWhat is the name of the \"second trailer\" that is shown just before the credits of the first chapter?\nDetails\nEdit\nRelease date\nApril 10, 2024 (United States)\nCountry of origin\nUnited States\nLanguage\nEnglish\nAlso known as\nФолаут\nFilming locations\nKolmanskop, Sperrgebiet, Namibia\nProduction companies\nAmazon StudiosKilter FilmsAmazon MGM Studios\nSee more company credits at IMDbPro\nTechnical specs\nEdit\nRuntime\n1 hour\nColor\nColor\nSound mix\nDolby Atmos\nAspect ratio\n2.39 : 1\nRelated news\nContribute to this page\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\nTOP GAP\nWhat was the official certification given to Fallout (2024) in Canada?\nAnswer\nSee more gaps\nLearn more about contributing\nEdit page\nAdd episode\nSponsored \nMore to explore\nList\nStaff Picks: What to Watch in April\nSee our picks\nPhotos\nThe Latest (and Greatest) New Posters\nSee the gallery\nList\nWhat We're Watching: Time Travel and Anime\nSee the full list\nRecently viewed\nClear all\nFallout\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb Data\nPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\nBack to top"
